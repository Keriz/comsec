Task 3:
ee-tik-cn005: 402 16
ee-tik-cn008: 385 32
ee-tik-cn009: 417 16

Regarding the automatic threshold detection, I decided to take the median over the access time from the first base address.
This should give me the average time in the row hits area as they are the majority of the measurements.
To this, I add half of the difference between the maximum access time and the median.
Although this is not the most robust method, this gives me more than acceptable results and the correct bank numbers.
