I created a script called plot.sh that gives me the accuracy (comparing the secret byte-by-byte for N=20 runs) and the execution time averaged over N runs.

I then call this script after changing the parameter in the given task program, and enter my results in the arrays of plot.py to generate the graphs.

For the task3 plot, I am running multiple rounds as well. Instead of changing the rounds, I found it to be more interesting to change the number of times the training function is called with a given number of rounds (R=2).

I struggled a lot to find that we needed a read(fd, XX, bytes) in the attacks to be able to read anything from the secret.
